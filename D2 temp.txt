1. Fix the has-secure-password

2. Initialize this project for backbone and bootstrap.

3. Have Backbone grab a reddit listing through the no-auth API (url.json)
  Cross-site javascript is bad and not allowed. Instead have routes for
  the client-side javascript to ask the server about things, then have
  the server request things and serve it to the client.

    Data can get to the backbone JS. I need a parsing strategy to turn
    the received data into useful visual stuff.

    I want to overwrite backbone's `parse`, so that I get a collection
    of backbone models that are individually manipulatable.

    Alternatively, do I even need backbone?

    Also, where should I do parsing? Do I pass along the raw reddit result,
    or should I trim it down to relevant information on the server side?

End: Push things to heroku
