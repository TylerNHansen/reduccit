1. Fix the has-secure-password

2. Initialize this project for backbone and bootstrap.

3. Have Backbone grab a reddit listing through the no-auth API (url.json)
  Cross-site javascript is bad and not allowed. Instead have routes for
  the client-side javascript to ask the server about things, then have
  the server request things and serve it to the client.

    Data can get to the backbone JS. I need a parsing strategy to turn
    the received data into useful visual stuff.

    I want to overwrite backbone's `parse`, so that I get a collection
    of backbone models that are individually manipulatable.

    Alternatively, do I even need backbone?

    Also, where should I do parsing? Do I pass along the raw reddit result,
    or should I trim it down to relevant information on the server side?

    What's my overall strategy for reddit integration - I think what I
    want is my app to have an anonymous participation layer on a
    specific subreddit. That is, shove my server and its API in between
    the client backbone stuff and the reddit server itself. That's a back-end
    time sink, which == AVOID.

    So, minimal back-end: each site user gets a reddit username/password.
    Since this site shouldn't be popular, I can hack around that by registering
    maybe 50 of them. Might want to add some 'fill this captcha' crap.

    I'll need to interact with reddit as a certain user, while holding
    their username/password. Interactions I need to support are:
      Viewing specific posts and/or collections of posts.
      Making comments.
      Adding posts to a given subreddit.
      User-to-user messages (maybelisted)

    Well, just do it first-things-first. Feature by feature.



So, I have this posts collection
  and I can make a new one
  and I can fetch from my server API
  and it gets a list of models
  test.models[0].get('url') - returns a URL
