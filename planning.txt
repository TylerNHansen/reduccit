First feature: start with sessions. User should get a session cookie
when visiting the index page. Get it to display an identifier at the top.

Get the DB to persist the no-name/password sessions. Test this by opening
up an incognito window - should make a new anonymous account.

There's a design decision here - keep anon account info inside a cookie, or
persist it to a database. I think I need to push it all to the client-side
until they want it persisted under a name/password combination. I mean,
way of accessing it other than from the cookie, there's no goddamn point
to saving it server-side. Wait, never mind, we want anon accounts to have
full functionality, which means upvotes/downvotes/views, which means
persisting who likes what to the DB. Save that shit - it's useful.

So, the design choice is figuring out where and when to trim un-needed data.
Maybe something like no votes on recently viewed content and no recent access.

The identifier is just some function of the user ID. Some way of mapping
from number to strings - not sure if I want a series of words
(think 'correct horse battery staple'). Scratch that, definitely want
a series of words like that.


Next, make sign-up work. It's basically just adding an email and password
to a user account. Or some way of identifying yourself - it actually isn't
really that important at this point. Basically anything that you can set
as something only you can use to get to your account.


--------------------------

Model - class User, with indexed token, email, password_digest (for now).
DB does not require any of these. This is fine - if they don't have it,
users are only unable to reach the accounts. I still want them for keeping
track of what posts people like.

Router - just the root page for now, make the site-wide stuff work first

Controller - going to have just one path. Need an application controller
for site-wide auth stuff and sessions. Index only for now.

Views - index.html. Just a success message, later features will fill this in.
