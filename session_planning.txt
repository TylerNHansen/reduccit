Funky structure things for users/sessions

currently we have some magical controller action-at-a-distance from inside
application.html.erb - it asks for the current user, which finds-or-creates
a session cookie, which isn't how we want to do this kind of thing.

So, let's initialize the @current_user before any controller does anything

Next up, we want to be able to do certain things:

1. Give the current account a new email/password combination.
2. Stop using the current account, and use a new account instead.
  forgetting the current session token should be plenty to do that
3. Enter an email/password and switch to that account

I need to name these in a way that maps to traditional account management words.
1. is something like "set [email, password]"
2. is something like "use new account"
3. is something like "sign in"

Sign up is strangely missing in this model.

changing email and password might need confirmation of current credentials.
That's patchable though - the simple form to change them is a baseline
for the anonymous case. It's an extra feature for later.

use new account is straightforward - just throw away the session token.

sign in is:
  1. Try to find the email/pass combination
    if success, make a new session token and set yours/account's tokens to it
    if failure, bring up failure page
      failure page can have helpful things like "email me a password reset link"


On second thought, I definitely want this to be a reddit *wrapper* and not
a reddit *clone*. That is, use reddit's oauth and API heavily to do cool
things.


So the accounts thing is use 1 of 2 options:
1. Use your reddit login. If you have a wrapper account, uses it
to sign into wrapper. If you don't, goes through the linking process.

2. Lurk. Gives you a temporary wrapper account for holding onto preferences,
likes, etc.
